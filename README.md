(Source :- wikipedia ) In mathematics, a Fourier series (/ˈfʊrieɪ, -iər/[1]) is a periodic function composed of harmonically related sinusoids, combined by a weighted summation. With appropriate weights, one cycle (or period) of the summation can be made to approximate an arbitrary function in that interval (or the entire function if it too is periodic). As such, the summation is a synthesis of another function.
